# ANN-Tuning
This project implements a neural network designed to classify fashion images, leveraging deep learning techniques for accurate recognition. The model has been optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, a powerful framework for automated hyperparameter optimization. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in identifying clothing items from datasets like Fashion MNIST or similar.
