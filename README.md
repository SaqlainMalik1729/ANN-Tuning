# ANN-Tuning
This project implements a neural network to classify fashion images, leveraging deep learning techniques for accurate recognition. The model has been optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, a powerful framework for automated hyperparameter optimization. The goal is to accurately identify clothing items from datasets like Fashion MNIST or similar.
